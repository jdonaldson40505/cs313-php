            <p class="bio">I hail from a little town in Washington state by the name of Gig Harbor. 
                I lived there until I was twenty years old and then served a mission in the New Jersey 
                Morristown mission. I started a bachelors degree in Business management and switched after I took 
                my first programming class and loved it! Outside of school I like to spend time outside hiking, fishing
                snowboarding and rock climbing and I am married to my beautiful wife who does most of those things with me!
            </p>
